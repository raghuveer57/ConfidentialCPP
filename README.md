This application has two parts.

It uses two separate CLI exe's for editing the file properties.

First Exe: WordDocumentUpdater.exe ( This is for MS apps ) 
Second Exe: AddCustomProperty.exe ( This is only for PDFs )

For MS apps, whenever the file is open , a side bar is shown where we can Set or UnSet the confidential property on that document.

For PDF files, the file should be closed, a context menu item called 'Check Confidential' is added for the PDF files to toggle the confidential status.
